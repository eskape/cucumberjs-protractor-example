# cucumberjs with protractor example
Since Cucumber is no longer included by default as of version 3.0, this example project integrates Cucumber with Protractor with the custom framework option. 
You can find more information about this here: https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/frameworks.md

This example project is by https://github.com/mlev/protractor-cucumber-example. It uses the the protractor-cucumber-framework.
This creates some basic cucumber tests using the same Super Calculator application used in the official Protractor tutorial - http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/
