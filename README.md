# cucumberjs with protractor example
Since Cucumber is no longer included by default as of version 3.0, this example prject integrates Cucumber with Protractor with the custom framework option. 
You can find more information about this here: https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/frameworks.md

This example project is using Protractor with Cucumber and the protractor-cucumber-framework.

Inspired by https://github.com/mlev/protractor-cucumber-example.
This creates some basic cucumber tests using the same Super Calculator application used in the official Protractor tutorial - http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/
